Assume that four LED’s are connected to MSP430 pin P1.0, P1.1, P1.2 and P1.3, all the other pins are connected to some external sensors, LEDs and actuators. Write the assembly code to blink the LED’s as the pattern [[1, 2],[2, 3],[3, 4]]. LED’s should be continuously blinked with a noticeable delay. When an external button is pressed, the loop should be stopped and toggle an LED connected to P1.6. When the button is pressed for the second time an LED connected to P1.7 should be toggled.
