Assume that three LEDs are connected to MSP430 pins P1.0, P1.1, P1.2 and P1.3. All the other pins are connected to some external sensors and actuators. Write the assembly code to blink the LEDs as given in Figure 1. LEDs should start blinking from Round 1 to Round 3 and cycling back from Round 1 continuously with a considerable delay. Use a push button to interrupt the operation of the microcontroller. When the button is pressed once, microcontroller toggle an LED connected to P1.6. Second push should activate an LED connected to P1.7. Please note that, you are not allowed to distract the operation of the other pins and ports of the microcontroller.
